# Utils

The `utils` directory contains a collection of utility scripts that are used in various parts of the project. The scripts are organized into subdirectories based on their purpose. Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` file that describes the scripts in that directory. Scripts can be in any language, but most are written in Python. The scripts are designed to be run from the command line, and they typically take command-line arguments to specify their inputs and outputs. It can be combined with NPM scripts to create a more powerful build system.
